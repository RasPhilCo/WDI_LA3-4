#Adopt-a-Pet (Angular Controllers & Repeat)

###What is this?
This code sample shows us how to create an angular controller and connect it to the view with the $scope object. This app displays all the avilable adoptable pets & allows users to add a new adoptable pet and to select and remove from the view any cat that has been adopted.

###Which topics did this connect to in class?
- angular controller w/ ng-controller directive
- angular repeat w/ ng-repeat directive

###What can I expect when I open this file?
A functional angular app. It contains some logic (functions) we haven't covered but take a look at them anyways!

There is no backend logic in this app.

###What can I do to extend this lesson?

- Add a feature that displays more attributes about the pet up for adoption, such as age, breed, etc.
